/* SEMFE Alumni: the settings that change. Loaded on every page before
 * site.js and auth.js.
 *
 *  1. FIREBASE: paste the web-app config from the Firebase console
 *     (Project settings > General > Your apps > SDK setup and configuration >
 *     Config). While any value still says PASTE_, sign-in stays switched off
 *     and the "Σύνδεση" button explains that registration opens soon. Nothing
 *     else on the site depends on it. Full walkthrough: FIREBASE-SETUP.md.
 *     These values are NOT secrets: every Firebase web app ships them to the
 *     browser. Access is controlled by firestore.rules.
 *
 *  2. AUTH_PROVIDERS: the sign-in buttons, in display order. List a provider
 *     only once it is enabled in Firebase console > Authentication >
 *     Sign-in method (a button for a provider that is not enabled fails with
 *     a clear message, but it is better not to show it at all).
 *       'google'   – Google / Gmail (built in)
 *       'facebook' – Facebook (built in; needs a Meta app)
 *       'linkedin' – LinkedIn (see LINKEDIN below and Part D of the guide)
 *     E-mail + password is always offered when Email/Password is enabled.
 *
 *  3. ADMIN_EMAILS: who sees the "Διαχείριση" (admin) page. This list only
 *     decides what the page SHOWS. What an admin may actually read and write
 *     is decided by isAdmin() in firestore.rules, which must list the same
 *     addresses (tools/check.mjs fails when the two differ).

                        must be EXACTLY providerId. Shorter to set up, but it
                        has a known bug with LinkedIn (see the guide). */
